# MATH_237_Project_1
Project 1 for MATH 237

In this notebook, I will look into a dataset that contains a number of sold homes in the city of Ames, Iowa. I have done data wrangling, visualization, and engineered important features to then build a multivariate regression model to output useful feature coefficients that can tell us important information regarding the predicted sales cost of homes.
